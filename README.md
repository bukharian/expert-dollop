Hi these are practise scripts written by me, as I am learning new things.

I want to share it with others for feedback and learn and grow more in this field.

The twitter_bot.py script logs in to your account and posts an automatic tweet, nothing complex its a very basic script and I was very excited when I did it!

The web_scrap_tutorial.py needs the url for the specific job the users requires for it to search at https://www.timesjobs.com/ and it will scrape the first page of the jobs that were recently posted.
It collects the company,skills and published date for the job, also the link redirecting to the page of the job.

example:
I searched for Java:"https://www.timesjobs.com/candidate/job-search.html?searchType=personalizedSearch&from=submit&txtKeywords=java&txtLocation="
After giving the url it will give you the information stated above.

It then ouputs the collected information to the directory chosen by the user in .txt format.
